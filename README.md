### Multi-Model Research Agent Showcase
The agent automates research by querying the Perplexity Sonar API using Claude and DeepSeek to gather, refine, and structure research findings. The Research Manager generates detailed insights from multiple queries, ensuring proper citations. The Research Compiler formats findings into structured Markdown with APA references. The Dataset Agent enhances results by sourcing extra datasets. Finally, all processed research is stored in a Supabase database for easy access and retrieval.
